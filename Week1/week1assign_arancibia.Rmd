####HA 2.1

For each of the following series (from the fma package), make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect.

```{r}
library(fma)
```

a) Monthly total of people on unemployed benefits in Australia (January 1956–July 1992).

```{r}
lambda.benefits <- BoxCox.lambda(dole)

plot(BoxCox(dole, lambda.benefits), main="Monthly People on Benefits", xlab="1956-1992", ylab="Number of people(Box-Cox transformed)")

title(main=paste("Box Cox lambda = ", signif(lambda.benefits, digits=3)), font.main=8, line=-1)

```


b) Monthly total of accidental deaths in the United States (January 1973–December 1978).

c) Quarterly production of bricks (in millions of units) at Portland, Australia (March 1956–September 1994).
