##KJ 8.1

Recreate the simulated data from Exercise 7.2:

```{r}
library(mlbench)
set.seed(200)
simulated <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
simulated <- cbind(simulated$x, simulated$y)
simulated <- as.data.frame(simulated)
colnames(simulated)[ncol(simulated)] <- "y"
```

a) Fit a random forest model to all of the predictors, then estimate the variable importance scores:

```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
model1 <- randomForest(y ~ ., data = simulated, importance = TRUE, ntree = 1000)
rfImp1 <- varImp(model1, scale = FALSE)
```

Did the random forest model significantly use the uninformative predic- tors (V6 â€“ V10)?
